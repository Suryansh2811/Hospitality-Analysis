# Hospitality-Analysis


Scenario:-
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.
You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task.
 
Start by discussing the problem statement which are:-

1.Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2.Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3.Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

Procedure:- 

After downloading all the files we go through the dataset given to us and look at the given dashboard to replicate it.
While working through the datasets in Power Bi, we go through the  datasets and make the necessary changes to it. 
After making all the necessary changes to our tables and dataset, we go to the data modelling column in Power Bi and create relationships within it.
After creating the relationships, we build the metrics using DAX. 

Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is a formula expression language used in Analysis Services, Power BI, and Power Pivot in Excel. DAX formulas include functions, operators, and values to perform advanced calculations and queries on data in related tables and columns in tabular data models.


First we create a few columns through DAX and then we create measures, The required list of measures have been given to us in the Metrics List Excel file.
We come across a new term here which is WoW(Week on Week) and a document has been attached regarding it, it basically states Week-on-Week (WoW) is a type of business metric that measures changes in a specific variable over a period of one week compared to the previous week. It is a common way of tracking business performance over time and is particularly useful for analyzing trends and identifying areas where improvements can be made.
While visualising our refined data we create a table to note down all the facts in front of us and we provide filters to them for narrowing down our search result like filtering by city, room type, date or week number and then compare the weekly revenue and changes. 
Then we move to the new page to create a tooltip.
And finally we finish the visualisations.
